# CSharp OO Jorn Schampheleer

This repo contains a project I had to complete for school.
We were free to program anything we wanted as long as we could incorporate the required learning goals.
I decided to program a Tetris game.
Graphically the game isn't as developed, but logically I was able to really challenge myself.
The game uses websockets to be able to connct 2 games and mirror the view.
It's almost like a "multiplayer" feature.
I am very happy with how it turned out and ended up getting a 19/20 for the course.
